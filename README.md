# Hello, I'm [Your Name]! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about **cybersecurity**, **ethical hacking**, and **coding tools** to help secure systems.

## ðŸš€ About Me

Iâ€™m a cybersecurity enthusiast and developer who enjoys building hacking tools and learning about the latest security vulnerabilities. Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new ways to secure and break systems in a safe, ethical manner.

```html
<style>
  .moving-text {
    font-size: 2em;
    color: orange;
    white-space: nowrap;
    overflow: hidden;
    position: relative;
  }

  .moving-text span {
    position: absolute;
    animation: move 5s linear infinite;
  }

  @keyframes move {
    0% {
      left: 100%;
    }
    100% {
      left: -100%;
    }
  }
</style>

<div class="moving-text">
  <span>I love coding in Python!</span>
</div>

### Key Changes:

1. **Moving Text**: The text `"I love coding in Python!"` now moves smoothly from right to left with the `@keyframes move` animation.
2. **CSS Styling**: The text is orange, and the movement is continuous (`infinite` loop).
3. **Personal Details**: Replace the placeholders `[Your Name]`, `your-email@example.com`, `your-twitter`, and `your-linkedin` with your actual information.
4. **GIF**: Replace `https://your-public-url.com/aboutme.gif` with the URL of your uploaded GIF.

### Steps to Use:

1. **Upload the GIF**: Host your `aboutme.gif` on a platform like Imgur, Dropbox, or directly in your GitHub repository, and use the public URL in place of the placeholder.
2. **Personalize**: Update the placeholders with your real details (name, contact, social links).
3. **Commit**: Once you've edited everything, commit this `README.md` file to your GitHub repository. It will be displayed on your profile page.

This will give you a dynamic and interactive "About Me" section on your GitHub profile with moving text and an animated GIF. Let me know if you need further assistance!
